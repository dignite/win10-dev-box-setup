# Win10 dev box setup

This is the repo storing scripts that used to setup my dev machine. Currently using Boxstarter+Choco+PowerShell combination. 

Plan to use Ansible has abandoned as that is not native to Windows [#3](/../../issues/3).

# Getting started
Navigate to [Boxstarter+Choco+PowerShell solution.](/choco-powershell) for the instructions to run setup.

# Built With

- Boxstarter
- Chocolatey
- PowerShell

This repo is for Win 10 dev box and mainly for a full stack developer. These scripts may not suit to your development environment setup requirements. But can be used as starting point to fork and customize.
